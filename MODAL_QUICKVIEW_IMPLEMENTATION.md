# ModalQuickview Dynamic Variation Loading Implementation

## Overview
Successfully refactored the ModalQuickview component to fetch product variations dynamically rather than receiving them as props. Added proper loading states and skeleton UI for a smooth user experience.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Variation Fetching
- Added `useEffect` hook to fetch variations when the component loads
- Used `getProductVariationsById` action to fetch variations from the API
- Added proper error handling and loading states

### 2. Loading States
- Added `isLoadingVariations` state to track loading status
- Created a `VariationSkeleton` component to show placeholder UI while loading
- Added loading indicators for price display and buttons

### 3. Skeleton Loading Component
- Created `VariationSkeleton.tsx` component with proper styling
- Matches the actual UI structure for color and size selections
- Uses project's CSS custom properties for consistent styling

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Disabled quantity controls during loading
- Updated button states to show "Loading..." when variations are being fetched
- Added conditions to only show skeleton for products with variations
- Improved console logging for debugging

### 5. Type Safety
- Maintained all existing type definitions
- Added proper error handling for API calls
- Ensured robust null checks and fallbacks

## Files Modified
- `components/Modal/ModalQuickview.tsx` - Main component refactoring
- `components/Other/VariationSkeleton.tsx` - New skeleton component

## Implementation Details

### Variation Fetching Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchVariations = async () => {
        if (!selectedProduct?.id || selectedProduct.variations.length === 0) {
            return;
        }

        setIsLoadingVariations(true);
        try {
            const result = await getProductVariationsById({ id: selectedProduct.id.toString() });
            if (result.status === "OK" && result.variations) {
                setVariations(result.variations);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching variations:', error);
        } finally {
            setIsLoadingVariations(false);
        }
    };

    if (selectedProduct) {
        fetchVariations();
        // Initialize color/size selections...
    }
}, [selectedProduct]);
```

### Loading State UI
- Shows skeleton for variation options only when `isLoadingVariations` is true AND the product has variations
- Disables all interactive elements during loading
- Displays appropriate loading messages in buttons

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Fallback to product-level pricing when variations fail to load
- Console logging for debugging issues

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Component maintains all existing functionality
- Proper loading states and error handling implemented
- UI remains responsive during loading states

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for use. The modal now:
1. Fetches variations dynamically on component mount
2. Shows proper loading states with skeleton UI
3. Maintains type safety and error handling
4. Provides a smooth user experience during loading

All requirements have been fulfilled successfully.
