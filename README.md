- A running [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) instance with REST API enabled

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakib-diu/woo-next-store.git
   cd woo-next-store
   git checkout performance-optimization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Using pnpm (recommended):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   Or using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your configuration:

   ```env
   # WordPress/WooCommerce Configuration
   WORDPRESS_SITE_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com
   WC_CONSUMER_KEY=ck_your_consumer_key_here
   WC_CONSUMER_SECRET=cs_your_consumer_secret_here
   
   # Stripe Configuration
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   
   # Optional: For direct WooCommerce API calls (if different from WordPress URL)
   WOOCOMMERCE_URL=https://your-woocommerce-site.com
   WOOCOMMERCE_KEY=ck_your_consumer_key_here
   WOOCOMMERCE_SECRET=cs_your_consumer_secret_here
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   Using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Or using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the store**:

   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the store in action.

**Platform Notes**: These instructions work across Windows, macOS, and Linux, as Next.js is platform-agnostic.
